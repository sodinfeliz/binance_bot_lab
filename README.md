# Binance Bot Lab

This is a personal project to research the mechanism behind Binance trading bots.
In Binance, there are several types of bots, including grid bots (spot and futures),
arbitrage bots, rebalancing bots and more. This project aims to build these bots
to understand their mechanisms and the impact of different parameters.
